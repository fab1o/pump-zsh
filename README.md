# Pump-zsh

**Pump-zsh** is an unofficial 'Oh My Zsh' plugin that provides a configurable set of aliases, functions, and themes to supercharge your terminal workflow.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/fab1o/pump-zsh/wiki) for more information.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Pump-zsh is via the provided install script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fab1o/pump-zsh/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.zsh | zsh && zsh
```

## Themes

In addition, Pump-zsh includes a collection of [built-in themes](https://github.com/fab1o/pump-zsh/wiki/Themes) for immediate use.

It also exports an environment variable called `CURRENT_PUMP_SHORT_NAME`, which represents the currently selected project. This can be used to customize your own theme.

## Dependencies

Pump-zsh includes a helper script to install all required dependencies. This script relies on [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Once Homebrew is installed, run the following:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fab1o/pump-zsh/refs/heads/main/scripts/install_deps.zsh | zsh && zsh
```
